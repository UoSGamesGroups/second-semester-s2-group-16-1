Group 14:
	
	Most common question:
		2 ideas
		Is that all you had?

		
	A slide that talked about the previous ideas you had 
	so we can see how you got to where you are now

		So that we can be sure this is not the only idea 
		that you considered
		
Group 15:

	Nearly every group:
		What other ideas did you have?
		
	Contextualize your presentation by saying we looked at 
	a range of different ideas including this and this 
	
Group 16:

	Question:
		You were asked to consider a number of different concepts 
		and ideas - did you?
		
		It would've been nice to see a slide which showed us what it was 
		that you've been considering, and why you chose this one over the 
		other one - what was it that made you choose this over the other idea?
		
		Otherwise it looks like this idea was taken from no where
		
Group 18:

	Question:
	
		You were asked to think about lots and lots of different ideas -
		did you?
		
		If you look at this from our point of view, we have no idea of what 
		else you've considered
		
		How did you reach the choice you made?
		
Group 19:

		Tell us about your previous ideas
		
			This is what we looked at
			These are the ideas we had
			This is the one we chose
				This is why we chose it
