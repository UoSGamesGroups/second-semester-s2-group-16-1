Hey Joseph,

For the first (mecha) arena:
-Put one circle "spring_mechanism" in each corner and one in the middle. They can have different sizes, depending on what you like (or see
most fitting).

For the second (ice_techno) arena:
-Put the curved "rotating_bars" in the middle. Make each spin 360 degrees ENDLESSLY but SYNCHRONIZED (at the same time) so that during each
full rotation they create an enclosed circle, dispersing and rotating again and again. 
There's a picture to help you understand.
Thanks!
